# Soldering Station for Weller Soldering Tips
This project is based on the work of Martin Kumm.

I made it simpler and cheaper. Instead of using an Arduino I use a ATmega8. This design doesn't use SMD instead a single sided PCB for easy assembly and cheap PCB production. The PCB is only 70x50mm. Instead of using two buttons to adjust the temperature I use a poti and optionally you can use a standard HD44780 compatible LCD to display temperatures.
